# CSZ-Tool
- This is a Draft project on automating the process of showing a LAG ID and clearing the MSAP of a user connected on a BNG(Nokia Alcatel-Lucent SR OS). 
- The Script doest not contain any Package or module to allow the script to ssh on a device since currently there are restrictions on my job role.
- This script has also a IP address scraper and ping those IPs(without duplicate IPs) then return the result of the ping test.


Possible Future revisions:
 1. Include a module to ssh on a network device then send specific commands needed. Perhaps make it multithreaded 
 2. Concert the codes to a class that can be reuse on future projects
 3. Add more Exception and Error Handling
